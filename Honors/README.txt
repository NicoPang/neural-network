HOW TO USE PROGRAM:

run_network.py is the mainfile. Type "python3 run_network.py" for usage.

You can tweak the hidden layers through the HIDDEN_LAYERS global variable in run_network.py.

There is varying accuracy overall, since the initial weights and biases are randomized. 

From testing, it seems the best accuracies I could get was when I had a single hidden layer of about 80-100 nodes.
